1)Methodology consists of four modules:

Module 1: Dataset analysis to extract insights and identify patterns.
Module 2: Hybrid approach combining multiple techniques for better outcomes.
Module 3: Ensemble supervised learning using multiple models for improved performance.
Module 4: Performance comparison to evaluate different systems or algorithms.
Implementation steps:

2)Obtain data sets from Kaggle repository.
Pre-process data using techniques like tokenization, punctuation removal, etc.
Split data into training and testing sets and convert to TF-IDF matrices.
Develop various ML models: Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and K-Means.
Test and evaluate models using metrics like Accuracy Predictor and F1 measure.

3)Stepwise algorithm structure used for clarity and consistency.
